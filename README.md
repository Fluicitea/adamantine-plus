# Adamantine+

A mod that adds Adamantine to Minecraft, as well as some other metals (some optional).

Tinkers' Construct and Armory supported!

Main Features:
-
- Adds Adamantine to the game!
  - Found deep underground (dig at around y=5 for best results).
  - Requires Obsidian pickaxe to mine.
  - Dwarves have been looking...and found some themselves! (usually)
    - Sometimes find Dwarven forges underground! Almost guaranteed Adamantine below, as well as some loot!
    - Dwarves know how to work with Adamantine, and if you find one of their forges, you can too!
  - Custom crafting of Adamantine gear.
    - Extract strands from raw adamantine.
      - Go mining or something, this will take a while...
    - Weave three strands into one wafer.
      - These are about 1/3 the size of a normal ingot. This will be important later.
    - Use an Adamantine Forge (requires lava for fuel) to create Adamantine gear.
      - Don't worry! The forge only uses fuel while you're forging gear.
- Obsidian gear!
  - Smelt Obsidian in a furnace to get one Obsidian gem.
  - Turn these Obsidian gems into gear like normal, or into Obsidian glass (storage block).
- Adds Copper, Lead and some other optional metals.
  - Found like any other ore in the game, at various (configurable) rates and depths.
- Copper and Lead harvest levels!
  - You need to dig Copper with a Stone pickaxe.
  - Once you have a Copper pickaxe, you can use this to dig Lead.
  - The Lead pickaxe can then dig Iron, and normal progression can commence!
